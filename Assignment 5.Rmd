## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Create the data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Airline = c("ALASKA", "ALASKA", "AM WEST", "AM WEST"),
  Status = c("on time", "delayed", "on time", "delayed"),
  Los_Angeles = c(497, 62, 694, 117),
  Phoenix = c(221, 12, 4840, 415),
  San_Diego = c(212, 20, 383, 65),
  San_Francisco = c(503, 102, 320, 129),
  Seattle = c(1841, 305, 201, 61)
)
#transformed into long data
long_data <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Los"):Seattle,
               names_to = "Destination",
               values_to = "Delay")





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#averaged delayed
average_delays <- long_data %>%
  group_by(Airline, Status) %>%
  summarise(Average_Delay = mean(Delay), .groups = 'drop')

# Visualize the data
ggplot(average_delays, aes(x = Airline, y = Average_Delay, fill = Status)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Arrival Delays by Airline and Status",
       x = "Airline",
       y = "Average Delay (minutes)",
       fill = "Status") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
